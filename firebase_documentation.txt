import "firebase_functions.js" to get access to these:

addEntry(username, nutrition)
	username should be a string, for now, there is no code to create new users, so just use "<TEST>" as the username every time
	
	nutrition should be an object of the following form:
	{
        calories: 0,
        fiber: 0,
        iron: 0,
        protein: 0,
        saturated_fat:0,
        unsaturated_fat:0,
        vitaminA:0,
        vitaminB:0,
        vitaminC:0   
}
	(of course the numbers don't have to be zero).
	The function will check if the user has any records for the present day,
	 if so it will add the new nutrition data to the existing data. If not, 
	it will add a new entry for the current day with the data.


getPresentDay(username)
	username same as before, use "<TEST>"
	ONLY CALL THIS IF YOU KNOW THERE IS DATA FOR THE PRESENT DAY
	to be sure there is data, you can just call addEntry with zeros
	in the object (if the entry doesn't exist it will fill it with 0
	if it does, it will add 0 having no effect). 
	The function returns an object of the form above with the correct
	values for the entered user on the present day
